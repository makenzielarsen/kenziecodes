        <h1>Makenzie Larsen</h1>
        <p>
          I am a Senior at Utah State University majoring in Computer Science
          with minors in Anthropology and Management Information Systems. I am
          passionate about the intersection of computing and human experience:
          from writing good, maintainable code, to the importance of product
          design and good user experience. My studies, volunteering, and work
          experience have given me technical and communication foundations. I am
          excited for opportunities to grow and create amazing software.
